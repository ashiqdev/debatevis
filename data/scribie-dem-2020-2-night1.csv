There is no reason why people who invest for a living should pay less than people who work for a living. That's ridiculous.

Casey Joe was a champion high school swimmer from a small town. She got sick, went to the emergency room and got hooked on opioids. The last thing that she said to her mom was, ""Mama, it's not my fault"" and she died. A lot of Americans say the same thing every day. And that is what I will stand up for, and what I will stand up against are companies like those pharma companies that got her hooked on those opioids, and didn't tell the doctors or the patients what was gonna happen. We need someone that has people's back, we also need someone that can win. And I have won in these red districts. I win in the Midwest. I can win in states like Wisconsin, and Michigan, and Iowa. I also will do my job without fear or favor, just like I did as a prosecutor; and get through the grid lock like I've done as a Senator, where I've passed over 100 bills where I've been the lead Democrat. And last yes, I will govern with integrity. We have a President where people turn off their TV when they see him. Not me. I will make you proud as your president.

To meet this challenge we have to have hope in one another and a faith in a future of this country that includes everyone. My whole life, I've been including people in the success of this country. Starting a small business with high value, high wage, high skilled jobs in the third poorest urban county in America. Serving on the city council and holding town hall meetings every single week to remind myself who it is that I serve at the end of the day. And in Congress being in the minority, but working with Democrats and Republicans alike to deliver for my constituents and this country. And then in Texas, this last year. Traveling to every county. Not writing anybody off, not taking anyone for granted. And at the end of the day, winning more votes than any Democrat had in the history of the State. Winning independence for the first time in decades, and winning nearly half a million Republicans. And those 38 electoral college votes in Texas are now in play, and I can win them. That is how we defeat Donald Trump in November of 2020 and how we bring this divided country together again in January of 2021. Thank you.

GDP is going up and life expectancy is going down. Think about what that means. It's only getting tougher. By 2030 we will have passed the point of no return on climate; there are gonna be 130 million more guns on our streets. I'll be in my 40s then. If you have kids, think about how old they will be then. But here's the good news, it's not too late. We can tell our kids that before we ran out of time, just before we ran out of time. In 2020, we did what it took to deliver a climate that we didn't have to wonder if it could support us. To deliver a society where race has no bearing on your health or your wealth or your relationship with law enforcement. That we did what it took to deliver an economy where a rising tide actually does lift all boats. We can do this. If and only if we are ready to walk away from what hasn't worked with bold action, and win. Not only defeat this President, but defeat his Congressional allies. With a defeat so big that it reunites the Republican Party with its conscience, as well as bringing Democrats to office. Join me and let's make it happen.

I wanted to be a public school teacher, but my daddy ended up as a janitor and by the time I graduated from high school, my family didn't have the money to send me off to college. My big chance, was what was then, a commuter college that cost $50 a semester. For me, what this election is all about, is opportunity. Every budget, every policy that we talk about, is about who's going to get opportunity. Is it gonna go to the billionaires or is it gonna go to our kids? Right now for decades, we have had a government that has been on the side of the rich and the powerful. It has been on the side of the wealthy. And that means it has not been on the side of everyone else. Not on the side of people living on our Native American reservations, people living in inner cities, people living in small farms, and small communities across this country. How do we beat it? We beat it by being the party of big structural change. Give people a reason to show up and vote, and we beat it by building a grassroots movement across this country. Not showing up behind closed doors with millionaires, but actually building it person-by-person across this country. With small dollar donations, with volunteers, with people who show up and say, ""I have a stake in this democracy"" I will not only beat Donald Trump in 2020, I'll start to make real change come 2021.

I'm running to transform this country, and to stand with the working class of America, which for the last 45 years has been decimated. Two days ago I had a remarkable experience, which should tell you everything you need to know about what's going on in America. I took 15 people with diabetes from Detroit, a few miles into Canada, and we bought insulin for one-tenth the price being charged by the crooks who run the pharmaceutical industry in America today. But it's not just the price-fixing, and the corruption, and the greed of the pharmaceutical industry. It's what's going on in the fossil fuel industry, it's what's going on in Wall Street, it's what's going on with the prison industrial complex. We need a mass political movement.
