I hear that question, but where was that question when the Republicans and Donald Trump passed a tax bill that benefits the top 1% and the biggest corporations in this country, contributing at least a $1 trillion to the debt of America, which middle-class families will pay for, one way or another. Working families need support and need to be lifted up, and frankly this economy is not working for working people. For too long the rules have been written in the favor of the people who have the most and not in favor of the people who work the most. Which is why I am proposing that we change the tax code. For every family that is making less than $100,000 a year, they will receive a tax credit that they can collect up to $500 a month, which will make all the difference between those families being able to get through the end of the month with dignity and with support or not.

It also needs to be more affordable in this country to not go to college.
